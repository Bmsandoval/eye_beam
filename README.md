cpu arch and ifs are expensive
- In retrospective, I get the impression that what \
  was asked for was less cpu usage, substituting memory usage.
  







Given an array of strings, group anagrams together.
Note:
All inputs will be in lowercase.
The order of your output does not matter.

Examples:
Input: ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat", "teae", "teaa"]
Output:
[
["ate","eat","tea"],
["nat","tan"],
["bat"],
["teae"],
["teaa"]
]
---
Input: ["abc", "cafe", "face", "cab",  "goo"]
Output:
[
["abc", "cab"],
["cafe", "face"],
["goo"]
]
